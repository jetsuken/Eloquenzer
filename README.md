# Eloquenzer
Sometimes we just want to work with an ORM system, and Eloquent is fine, but we don't need (or don't want) all Laravel framework, only his ORM.

Eloquenzer is intended for this cases. Just run the script, give it access to your MySQL database and it makes a funcionally and basic back-end. I created this code based in <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/es/tutorials/using-illuminate-database-with-eloquent-in-your-php-app-without-laravel--cms-27247" target="_blank">this guide</a> (in spanish, because I'm a native taco speaker).

Feel free to take and improve it.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Eloquenzer asummes that python and composer are installed before all. Please make sure of that.
